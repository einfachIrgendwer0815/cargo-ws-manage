# 0.2.0

- enhancement of the 'NEW' command:

  - choose whether to make a root crate (library and binary)

  - make other member crates in the workspace (library and binary)

  - the names of the crates (specified in the Cargo.toml files) may the differ from the directory names the crates are made in

  - member crates can be added as dependencies of the root crate


# 0.1.0

- command 'new' was added with very basic options to create a new workspace with or without a root crate
